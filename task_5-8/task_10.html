   <h1><u>What is the introduction of math?</u></h1>
   <div>Mathematics is the <mark>science and study of quality, structure, space, and change.</mark> Mathematicians seek out patterns, formulate new conjectures, and establish truth by rigorous deduction from appropriately chosen axioms and definitions.
    There is debate over whether mathematical objects such as numbers and points exist naturally or are human creations. The mathematician <b>Benjamin Peirce</b> called mathematics <q><u>the science that draws necessary conclusions.</u></q> <mark>Albert
    Einstein</mark>, on the other hand,
     stated that <u><q>as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.</q></u> 
    <u><q>Today, mathematics is used throughout the world as an essential tool in many fields, including natural science, engineering, medicine, and the social sciences.</q></u> Applied mathematics, the branch of mathematics concerned with application
    of <b>mathematical knowledge </b>to other fields, inspires and makes use of new mathematical discoveries and sometimes leads to the development of entirely new disciplines. Mathematicians also engage in pure mathematics, or mathematics
    for its own sake, without having any application in mind, although practical applications for what began as pure mathematics are often discovered
